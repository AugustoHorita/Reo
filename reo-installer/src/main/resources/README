====
For Unix-like Systems :

You need to set some environment variable before being able to use Reo. In your shell, execute the following commands:

	>$ export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:.:$DIR/bin/reo-runtime-java.jar:$DIR/bin/reo-runtime-java-lykos.jar"

	>$ alias reo='java -jar $BASEDIR/bin/reo-1.0.jar'	

If you want to make Reo setting automatic for each Shell sessions, you can either run "reoinit.sh" or happen in your ~/.bashrc manually :

	>$ source $BASEDIR/.reosource

Close and open a new terminal to make it effective or run 

	>$ source ~/.bashrc
